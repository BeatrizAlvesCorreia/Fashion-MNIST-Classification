# Fashion-MNIST-Classification
This repository aims to creating a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The task includes setting up the dataset, visualizing the data, preprocessing, and building a model for multi-class classification.
This challenge is separated into 2 scripts:
- Part1
- Part2
Both parts of the challenge focus on different aspects of image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Part 1 deals with multi-class classification, while Part 2 addresses binary classification. Both parts include data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras, with visualization of data and results.
